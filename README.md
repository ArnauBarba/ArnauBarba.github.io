ARCHITECTURE INFORMATION 

To organize the CV, I started by creating a "main-container" that encompasses all the code, which basically delimits all the margins. Within this "main-container", I create a "main_content" that does a similar function also encompassing everything, but this time focuses on organizing the content. Within these "main-container" and "main_content", I stated "left_area" and "right_area" to differentiate the right side from the left, and thus put the relevant content in its place. We can also find a grid to delimit. 

Once we have all this, in each different section we will have its corresponding class (one or several) to collect the information.

Also, we can notice in the firsts lines of the code a link that allows us to have the small images in the different sections.


STYLE INFORMATION 

For the CSS file first of all we import a url taken from internet to have the most beautiful letter. 

Next, we declare all the colors of both letters and backgrounds, to make it easier for us later. We could seize and declare more things, but from my point of view, the rest is not necessary because it is not so repetitive or messy.

Once we have all this done, we simply look at the HTML and make beautiful everything declared previously.

At first I had in my mind to do something more minimalist and with pastel colors, but in the end I decided in part to keep the minimalist design, although the colors I have decided to put more sober. So I chose black, gold and white because they seem to me a very elegant combination.
